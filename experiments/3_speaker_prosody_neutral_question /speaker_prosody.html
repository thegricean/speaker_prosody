    <p id="instruct-text">You will hear interactions involving a person named Julie and will answer some questions about these interactions. Upon reading the background for these interactions and listening to the two speakers, you will answer a question regarding how compatible one speaker's answer is with the question. <strong>Make sure that you are either wearing headphones or have the ability to listen to audio through speakers.</strong> Also, make sure your volume is turned up.
      <br>The HIT should take about 10 minutes. Please pay attention -- thanks!</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>Two friends are chatting and catching up on what's been going on in their respective lives. You will hear them talking about 14 different things. You will be asked a question after hearing the dialogues between Julie and her two friends, either Mike or Stan.

    <p><strong>Please listen to each dialog carefully. You can only listen to it once upon proceeding to the question.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Use either closed cask headphones or ear buds.</strong></p>

    <p>Please listen to the interaction in full before answering any of the questions. You will not be able to continue the HIT until you have listened to the audio. You will start with 3 practice trials to get the hang of the experiment.</p>
