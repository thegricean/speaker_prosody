# Interaction of prosody and speaker knowledge in scalar implicature

This is a follow-up on de Marneffe & Tonhauser, testing whether the rise-fall-rise contour interacts with the speaker's knowledge state. In particular, if the RFR doesn't have a pre-defined "uncertainty" meaning, but rather is interpreted in a context-dependent way, we expect:

1. Scalar implicatures should be **stronger** when RFR is present and speaker is knowledgeable compared to neutral prosodic baseline.
2. Scalar implicatures should be **weaker** when RFR is present and speaker is ignorant compared to neutral prosodic baseline.
